    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>An experienced marketing manager, working at both strategic and hands on level.  Iâ€™m a natural communicator with a creative, yet organised mind. With years of experience in business I have an innate understanding of client needs and the right tone for external and internal communications in all formats.
        Five years experience building a trusted industry brand  for company supplying   construction related services.  Brand, product, social media marketing and website management for a B2B business.  My graphic design skills and confidence at using Wordpress Elementor have saved thousands on agency costs each year. 
        I am looking for a varied marketing or content management role where I can use my experience to grow sales, brand awareness and customer loyalty.</p>
